    <h2>"Eyes up, Guardian!"</h2>
        <p> For project 1 of ITDEV-160, I decided to create a fan's introductory page for the video game Destiny 2. </p>
        <p>Destiny 2 is what is known as a post-apocalyptic "Massively-Online, First-Person, Looter-Shooter" or <abbr title="">MOFPLS</abbr>  Video Game, launched in 2014 and developed by Bungie Entertainment Inc., the Developers behind the Original Halo Series. It is the direct sequel to the original game, titled "Destiny".</p>
        <P>Destiny 2 was originally published by Activision, but in recent years, Bungie has been developing and Publishing Destiny related content.</P>
        <p>As is Genre implies, Destiny 2 is primarily played online with yearly expansions. The most current expansion, is Witch Queen. The game features some single player(SP), cooperative(COOP) and multiplayer(PVP) characteristics to it.</p>
        <p>With the Destiny series, Bungie was one of the pioneers in what is called Player VS Everything(PVE), which in contrast with single player, and Player VS Players allows multiple players to interact with the world as well as compete with each other at the same time. Destiny is a great blend between COOP, SP, and PVP.</p>
