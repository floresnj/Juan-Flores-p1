    <h1> Destiny 2: The Story </h1>
    
        <p> The Story of Destiny takes places thousands of years into our future, and across our solar system. About 700 years
        into our future, humanity discovered the first signs of extraterrestrial intelligence, in the form of what was
        called "
        "The Traveler". A Terraforming intelligence which humanity first met while it was terraforming the martian
        landscape, after The Traveler was observed terraforming a Jovian moon. </p>

    <h3>What happened?</h3>
        <p>Meeting the Traveler ushered in what was known as "Humanity's Golden Age" in this era humanity advanced in a short
        spam of time what it hadn't advance for thousands of years. The traveler tripled humanity's lifespan, and helped
        humanity develop technologies which allowed humanity inhabit almost all of the solar system. Cities were build
        around every planet or moon the traveler touched." And for about one Thousand years humanity grew and expanded, but
        this was not to last.
        With Humanities advancement, other intelligence came after the traveler. This intelligence was known as "The
        Darkness". Contrasting the Light and Advancement brought about by The traveler, The Darkness brought with it rapid
        destruction, and with The Darkness others civilizations followed in search of the technology and resources developed
        by The Traveler on our Solar system. This period is known as "The Collapse". </p>
    <h3> Enter: The Guardian</h3>
    
        <p> However, what was left of humanity was defenseless again the looming threat, as it was dying, the traveler created
        miniature copies of itself, now known as Ghosts, and this allowed for selected group of beings to be resurrected,
        receive immortality and the strength to fight for humanity. These beings are known as Guardians.
        The battle between the Darkness and The Traveler resulted in a stalemate. This stalemate was broken when the
        Traveler,
        sacrifice itself and in doing so expelled the darkness from the system. this left humanity defenseless against the
        other
        alien forces still roaming the solar system. </p>
        <p>And just when humanity needs you the most, a ghost, your Ghost, finds YOU, the player and wakes you up from death to
        fight for the good of humanity, as a <em>"Guardian of the Light"</em> , or simply a <b>"Guardian"</b>. </p>
    
            <blockquote><em><b>"Eyes up, Guardian!"</b> Your Ghost, upon resurrecting you as the "Guardian"!</em></blockquote>
